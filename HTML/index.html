                <p>As a finance professional I focus on accounting, report preparation and data analysis, as a developer I want to learn how the software 'thinks'. I will develop my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python (plus more after that). Here
                    I will give an update of my finished projects. One of my first project is this website itself. I could choose a very fancy website build by someone else to show my amateuristic projects to make them look good, but why not show them
                    in a website designed by myself from scratch? This way my website becomes personal and shows my website skills to you. Through time I will develop this website to show more and more of myself. I will add a logbook and a timeline on
                    this website about the changes made to this website.</p>

                <p>Should I start with the obvious? I might just as well. My name is Marcus, currently 31 years old. Since 2004 I have been studying for financial accounting, economics and tax and working at the same time. Currently I hold a bachelor in
                    economics and intend to continue my masters in professional accounting. The last 4 years I have lived and worked in The Netherlands, Australia and Indonesia. This year I will move to New Zealand to live and work for initially 1 year.
                    I feel that I have to expand my knowledge and start learning about programming. Programming is a helpful skill to have and it is usefull to understand how the programs we work with function.</p>

                        on where to write the different links to external sources, such as CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and other 'libraries'.

                        In my first project I used JavaScript (jQuery) to push the objects to the DOM. I loved this way of working because it kept my HTML pretty clean. What I also like about JavaScript is the logical part and the mathematics. In the next 12 months I want to
                        make my websites more dynamic. I also want to learn to use JavaScript to create (add-on) programs for my website. Another thing is that I would like to find out if I can use JavaScript to create programs that function between Microsoft
                        programs. As Microsoft is great, but not perfect, I would like to personalize the software this way.

                        As we speak I do not know much (nothing) yet about Python. What I do know is that Python is used for back-end programming and it can be very usefull for finance related work. My goal for the next 12 months with Python is to understand the basics. What
                        is Python, how can I use it and what can I build with it.
