Portfolio Website

24/06/2018 --> At this point the 'Responsive Web Design' part from freeCodeCamp is finished. This included making 5 projects in total which are all included in this portfolio. The next section to study about will be JavaScript. In the meantime I will also try to update my portfolio website as I am not satisfied about the layout.

19/06/2018 --> I have build this website in May 2018 to be able to show to other people what I have done so far. One of my greatest challenges besides developing technical skills is how to design a website or application. Sometimes I believe my work looks quite alright, but actually the opposite is true.

I have 3 finished projects so far, "Tribute Page", "Portfolio Website" and "Survey Form". The Portfolio Website however is an ongoing process. I have a dream about my Portfolio Website and skill-wise I am not yet able to build thing the way I want. Step by step I try to show more and more of what my intentions are.

My business website is also an ongoing project that must be finished before years-end.

I must structure the files also, I need to learn how to organise all files properly so they are easy to track for outsiders.

Later I want to integrate more programming languages/styles to my portfolio website to explore and show different skills.
